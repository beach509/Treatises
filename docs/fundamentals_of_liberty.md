# Fundamentals of Liberty

This is an attempt to outline the fundamental principles upon which more complex discussion can be built. It is an attempt to describe reality. I.e. it is an attempt to describe Truth.

The ideas outlined below are not new and are heavily inspired by people much smarter than myself.

## Definitions

- **Rights** → A set of conditions/entitlements intrinsic to every individual
- **Liberty** → The ability for an individual to realize their rights without interference from other individuals or Collectives
- **Collective** → Any group of individuals organized for mutual benefit or security
- **Governing Body** → A special Collective ideally established to enforce the will of the wider Collective. Fundamentally, a Governing Body is a special Collective willing to use force on individuals or other Collectives
- **Violator** → An individual or Collective who infringes on other individual's rights

## Treatise 

Humankind is endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. I.e. every person inherently has certain God given rights and these rights belong to every individual irrespective of any human ruleset.

Laws are justified only when there is a moral foundation combined with a logical implementation. The absence of either means the only authority for the law is use of force.

The Constitution of the United States is a set of laws built on Christian morality with the core logical principle being the restriction of the Governing Bodies's ability to infringe on the individual's rights.

The Constitution of the United States was written to ensure these rights were not violated by the Governing Bodies. The Constitution is an acknowledgement of these rights, it does not GRANT these rights. I.e. every person inherently has these rights even if the Constitution did not exist.

The Constitution was made to RESTRICT the U.S. Governing Bodies such that U.S. individuals and U.S. Collectives could function with minimal violation of U.S. member's rights. The Constitution provides a metric by which individuals can evaluate the performance of its Governing Bodies. I.e. If the Governing Bodies are outside the bounds of the Constitution, they are violating the rights of the individual and therefore that Body's authority is derived only by use of force.

The responsibility of exercising and defending these inherent rights falls to the owner of those rights. I.e. every individual is responsible for defending their rights.

If an individual is violating the rights of another individual at the behest of a Collective (whether that Collective is a government, business, family unit, etc.), the violating individual's only authority is their willingness to use force. I.e. from the perspective of justification, the individuals motivation for violating another's rights is irrelevant (e.g. just doing ones job, families to feed, experienced difficult circumstances, for the safety or wellbeing of the individual being violated, didn't know any better, etc.).

Rights can only be violated by the use of force (either direct or the threat thereof).

When ones rights are being violated, one has three options.
- **Capitulate:** One can surrender their rights in the hope that the resulting consequences allow the individual to keep their life and maintain their status quo (less the right they are surrendering). If an individual decides to take this option (and as long as they continue to take this option) they MUST acknowledge that they will no longer be able to influence the further erosion of their rights or the rights of others (they are not willing to use force to defend their rights and those violating them are).
- **Evade:** One can exercise their rights surreptitiously and take all measure to avoid direct confrontation by the Collective authority to ensure the consequences of exercising said rights is minimized. If an individual decides to take this option (and as long as they continue to take this option) they MUST acknowledge that it is a stopgap measure. Eventually they will be confronted with a scenario where one of the other two options must be chosen.
- **Fight:** One can exercise their rights and use force against those who would seek to violate them. If an individual decides to take this option (and as long as they continue to take this option) they MUST acknowledge that the outcome of this course of action can lead to death. Since use of force is the only authorization for a violators actions, and since the use of force is not generally utilized unless the outcome is relatively certain, the violator will almost certainly be in a position where success (and therefore the death of the individual choosing to fight) is highly probable.

All three options are equally acceptable only when used in concert. The general misunderstanding is that the response to most violations should be capitulation (or if the violation is more extreme, evasion). Individual victims of violations rationalize this because the immediate and obvious consequence of exercising the fight option compels the victim to justify their unwillingness to fight.

# Examples of violations

**"Minor" violations (violations by other individuals or a mildly overreaching Collective)** → E.g. an individual decides to steal from another. The victim can decide to capitulate because they judge that the thief will not do more than steal. The hope of the victim is to correct the infringement at a later point with the help of other likeminded individuals (through use of force). The risks with this course of action are that once the victim has capitulated, the thief may decide they are less likely to be caught if they murder the victim. Now that the victim has surrendered, it will be even more difficult to exercise the other options.

**"Medium" violations (localized violations by a Collective)** → E.g. A local government passes a law restricting the sale of a category of goods. It may be determined by those evading/capitulating that, in the short term, the violation is acceptable, because in the medium term, the violation of rights can be reversed utilizing an established process. Most will follow the ruleset established while some will continue selling the goods in an "unlawful" manner. If they are caught by the local enforcement apparatus, they will then capitulate with the law in the hopes of preventing other rights from being removed. The risks with this course of action are that the local Governing Body will not reverse the violation but instead add other violations. Since the violation has been demonstrated "acceptable" other Collectives will also begin violating the same rights. This will result in more evasion/capitulation with the outcome being more rights being violated in a logarithmic escalation.

**"Major" violations (widespread violations by multiple Collectives or large Collectives)** → E.g. A state or federal government passes a law restricting the sale of a category of goods. "Major" violations are generally re-categorized as "Medium" violations by the victims (or those near the victims) because to acknowledge the widespread violation would require actions with severe consequences. The ultimate result of "Major" violations is the total suppression of individual liberties.
