# Fundamentals of Liberty FAQ

**Where does the voting process fit in?**

Voting is a form of capitulation (depending on the law, evasion may take place as well). All 3 options are acceptable in the correct circumstances. It is important to realize that capitulating while working within a collective structure to move back in the right direction is a good and civilized solution. However, it is also important to realize that when capitulation by voting continues to move ones position further from ones inherent rights, one continues to capitulate because the consequences of evasion or fighting are to severe. 

**This "treatise" seems to be very pessimistic/fatalistic**

My objective is to be realistic. I am attempting to define what liberty is, and how ones liberty is their inherent right (and their responsibility to exercise and protect). If someone chooses an option, it is important to understand why they are choosing that option instead of shrouding it in justifications that allow them to live with their decision without actually acknowledging their rational. If someone finds this to be pessimistic or fatalistic, they must ask themselves why they think that is. They may find the answer is because when looking at ones ability to exercise their inherent rights in the current system, their liberty is so restricted when compared to the rights protected in the constitution that evasion/fighting would seem to be the only correct options. Since those options are dire, this could be construed as pessimistic or fatalistic.
